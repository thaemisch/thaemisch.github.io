# gitzeug

A CLI toolkit for streamlined Git operations.

## About
Git is a very powerfull tool. But sometimes, I don't need powerfull. I need simple, easy, fast.

**gitzeug** is a command-line utility designed to simplify Git tasks. 

The name **gitzeug** is inspired by the German word *Werkzeug*, which means "tool." The etymology of *Werkzeug* comes from *werk* ("work") and *zeug* ("stuff"). Sooo ... a tool for git, basically. Thanks for the inspiration, [Werkzeug](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug).

## Features

- **Download Specific Files or Directories**: Clone only the files or directories you need from a Git repository using sparse checkout.
- **Streamlined Push Workflow**: Stage all changes, commit with a message, and push in a single command.
- **Squash**: Squash the last n commits with a custom commit message.
- **Browse**: Browse the file tree of the repo without cloning it.

## Requirements
âœ… `git`
