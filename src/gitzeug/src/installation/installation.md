# Installation
At the current state of this project, I feel like it is not worthy to be included in package managers, so you will have to build the binaries yourself. Unless you use NixOS [with flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/nixos-with-flakes-enabled).

[NixOS](./nixos.md)  
[Binaries](./binaries.md)
